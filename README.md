What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind.
Call: The call() method invokes a function with a given this value and arguments provided one by one
ex.
var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
  console.log(
    greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
  );
}

invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
